              My backend site is designed to handle user authentication and content management efficiently. It provides basic login and logout functionality, ensuring secure access for registered users. New users can create an account, set up their profile, and start posting content on their personal feed.
<br></br>
Once logged in, users can share updates, posts, or any information they want to display on their profile. The system manages user sessions, keeping track of authenticated users while maintaining security. Each user has their own profile where they can see their posts and possibly interact with others, depending on future enhancements.
<br></br>
The backend is structured to handle requests smoothly, ensuring a seamless experience for users. Whether logging in, signing up, or posting content, the system efficiently processes data and maintains user sessions to keep everything running smoothly.

              My chess project is a backend-based game that allows two players to play against each other in real-time. It handles player moves, validates them according to chess rules, and ensures a smooth gameplay experience. The backend manages game sessions, stores move history, and prevents invalid moves. Since it's a two-player game, there's no AI, but it provides a fair and structured environment for users to enjoy chess online.

              <p className="">Time Capsule - My First Hackathon Project

Time Capsule was my first hackathon project, designed as a platform where users could store digital messages, media, or documents to be accessed at a future date. The core idea was to allow users to send messages to their future selves or to loved ones, preserving memories, thoughts, and goals in a secure and time-locked format.
<br></br>
Key Features:
‚úÖ Time-Locked Messages ‚Äì Users could set a specific date and time for when their stored content would be unlocked.
‚úÖ Secure Storage ‚Äì Data was encrypted to ensure privacy and security until the release date.
‚úÖ Multimedia Support ‚Äì Allowed users to save text, images, audio, or even short videos.
‚úÖ User Authentication ‚Äì Ensured only authorized users could access their time capsules.
‚úÖ Email Reminders ‚Äì Sent users a notification when their time capsule was ready to be opened.
<br></br>
The Inspiration:
The idea came from the concept of traditional time capsules‚Äîphysical boxes buried with meaningful items, only to be opened years later. This digital version brought the same sentiment to the online world, making it easier for people to store and relive memories without the risk of physical decay.
<br></br>
Technical Implementation:
The project was built using a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, and MongoDB for storing user data and time capsules. A scheduler handled the timed release of messages, ensuring that capsules remained locked until their intended reveal date.
<br></br>
Hackathon Experience:
Participating in the hackathon taught me a lot about rapid development, teamwork, and problem-solving under pressure. It was an exciting challenge, and seeing the project come to life was incredibly rewarding.
